## Experiment 4 Inheritance

1.__Question 1 Create a base Class(super class) and a derived class (sub class) with a few attributes and methods . Demonstrate inheritance by accessing superclass and subclass members .__

2.__Question 2 Create a Java Program that models a basic hierarchy of vehicles . You Should have a base class Vehicle with attributes like make , model and year and a method displayinfo() to display information about the vehicles Then , create two subclasses Car and Motorcycle that inherit from the Vehicle class__
__The Car class Should have an additional attribute numDoors__
__The Mototcycle class Should have an additional attribute engineType__
__In the main program , create instances of both Car and Motorcycle objects , set their attributes , and call the displayinfo() method for each to display their respective information .__
