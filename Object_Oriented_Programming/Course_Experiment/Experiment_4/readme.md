    <p>Experiment 4 Inheritance</p>
    <p>Question 1 Create a base Class(super class) and a derived class (sub class) with a few attributes and methods . Demonstrate inheritance by accessing superclass and subclass members . </p>
    <p>Qquestion 2 Create a Java Program that models a basic hierarchy of vehicles . You Should have a base class Vehicle with attributes like make , model and year and a method displayinfo() to display information about the vehicles Then , create two subclasses Car and Motorcycle that inherit from the Vehicle class
    The Car class Should have an additional attribute numDoors
    The Mototcycle class Should have an additional attribute engineType
    In the main program , create instances of both Car and Motorcycle objects , set their attributes , and call the displayinfo() method for each to display their respective information .</p>
    <p>Question 3 Write a program to simulate logical AND and OR operation on boolean . </p>
    <p>Question 4 Write a program to find the maximum of two numbers using ternary operator . </p>
    <p>Question 5 Calculate the absolute value of a number using the ternary operator . </p>
